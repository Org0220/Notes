* `Economics` is a social sience that examines how people choose among the alternatives available to them
* It is `social` because it involves people and their behavior 
* It is a ` science because it uses a scientific approach in its investigation of choices
* People make `choices`: all choices mean that one alternative is selected over another 
* Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resouces to satisfy their unlimited wants 
* `Resources` are things used to produce other things to satisfy people's wants 
* `Wants` are what people would buy if their incomes were unlimited
    * Goods, services and goals to achieve
* Our resources are limited: at any one time we have only so much land, so many factories, so much oil, so many people
* By iyr wabtm iyr desures fir tge tgubgs tgat we cab produce with those resources are unlimited: we would always like more and better of everything 
* `Scarcity` refers to the condion that arises because wants always exceed what can be produced with limited resources
* A `scarce good` is one for which the choice of one alternative use of the good requires that another be given up
* With limited resources, people must make choices to satisfy their wants.
* We never have enough of everything including money and time, to satisgy our every desire.
* Individuals, buisnesses and nations face alternatives, and choices must be made
* Economics studies how these choices are made.


# Demand and Supply

## Shifts in Supply
* Determinants of supply 
    * technology and productivity 
    * Cost of inputs
    * Price expectation of sellers

* A change in technology alters the combinations of inputs or the types of inputs required in the production process

    * An improvment in technology usually means that fewer and/or less costly inputs are needed 

```
In some words, better technology = more supplies 
```

* Changes in seller's expectations can have important effects on price and quantity

```
If they think that the price will change by the time, suppliers will supply less products depending on if it goes up or down.
If the price goes up, the supply will also increase, if the price goes down, the supplies will also decrese since it wont be profitable
```

* Natural events such as storms, insect infestations, and drought affect gricultural production and thus the supply of agricultural goods.

```
if for example heat kills the vegetables, the supplier will give less vegetables since they lost their supplies.
```

* The supply curve for industry, such as coffee, includes all the sellers in the industry
* A change in the number of sellers in an indusry changes supply
```
If you have more suppliers giving you the product, it will increase the number of products that you recive
```

* Change in supply vs changes in quantity supplied.

```
The only change that can impact the posibility curve are factors other than price and quantity
```

4. Consider the market for laptops. Explain wether the following events would cause an increase or decrease in supply or decrease in the quantity supplied.
    * The pirce of memory chips used in laptops declines. 
        ```
        Supplies wil increase since the price of inputs decreased, so it will be cheaper to produce laptops from now
        ```
    * The number of laptop manifcature increases

        ```
        The supply will increase since we have more selleres than before. 
        ```
    * An imporvment of technology reduces the cost of production of laptops.

        ```
        It will increase the supplies since we will be able to produce laptops with less expences
        ```
    * The price of laptops decreases.
        ``` 
        The posibility curve will stay on it's place since the decrease in product's price will decrease supplies and both the quantity and the price will go down togethere.
        ```

## Putting Demand and Supply Together
<img src="Screenshot 2022-02-10 090817.png"> </img>
* If the price is too low, the producers will supply less, but the demand will be high and if the price of a product is high, the suppliers will supply more, but the demand on the product will be less.
* In the end, there should be a gold middle where the suppliers will like to supply the same amount as the costumers woud like to buy.

* The price is usually set by the intersaction of Demand and Supply curves:

  <figcaption>E is the equilibrium</figcaption>
</figure>

* Equilibrium: is a situation in which quantity supplied equals quanity demanded at a practicular price
* Shortage: is a situation in which quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied
    * Shortages exist at any price below the market cleraing price
* Surplus: is a situation in which quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded

* A shift a demand or supply curve changes the equilibrium price and quantity for a good or service


* Demand chagnes:
    * Demand +: Price +, Quantity +
    * Demand -: Price -, Quantity -

* Supply changes:
    * Supply + : Price -, Quantity +
    * Supply - : Price +, Quantity -

## Sumarry
* The law of demand: at a higher price people buy less; at a lower price, people buy more
* Distinguish between changes in demand and changes in quantity demanded
    * A change in quantity demanded is a movement along the same demand curve
    * A change in demand is a shift of the whole demand curve
* Law of supply: firms offer more at a higher price; firms offer less at a lower price
* Distinguish between changes in supply and changes in quantity supplied
    * Change in quantity supplied is a movement along the same supply curve

* The interaction of demand and supply determines the equilibrium price and quantity 
* Surplus exists when the price of the good is above the market price
* Shortage exsists when the price of a good is below the market price
* Changes in demand and supply affect teh equilibrium.

## Review exercises
5.
    1. If the price in the notebook market is 14 $ per notebook is, there a shortage  or a surplus 
    of notebooks? NHow much is the shortage or surplus?
        Surplus since there is less demand than supply
        Supply: 5
        Demand: 3 
    2. If the pirce = 8$
    shortage since there is less amount of supplies than demanded
        Supply: 2
        Demand = 6
    3. Equlibrium is 12 p q 4

    4. Studies indicate that students understand lectures better whem they've taken hand-written notes. 
        The demand curve shifts to the left, so both Price and Quantity goes highter
