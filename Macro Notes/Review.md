## Graphs in economics

    * Inverse: Negative slope
## Important terms: 
### Production 
    Any activity that results a conversation of resources to a product (Goods or services) that can be used by customers 
### Utility

### Trade-offs
    All choices sacrificed when making one choice
## Production possibilities curve (PPC) 
    Represent how much we sacrefise by producing one good or serivce compare to another one.
    For example the PPC can be about apples and meat. If we produce more apples, we will produce less meat and vice versa

    - Robinson Crusoe economy 
    – Economic growth
        If the slope moves to the right-top. So we are able to produce more of two the goods on PPC. This happens due to the points discussed on the top.
## Specialization and trade: 
absolute and comparative advantage 
- Robinson Crusoe and Anna's economy8. 
Law of demand and supply 
– Individual demand/supply curve 
– Market (aggregate) demand/supply curve
## Changes in demand/supply and changes in the quantity demanded/supplied
– Shifts in demand curve or supply curve
## Determinants (factors) of demand and supply
## Equilibrium market price and quantity 
### Equilibrium
    Equilibrium is the point in the intersection of demand curve and supply curve. 
    In the intersaction both suppliers want to supply as much as customers want to buy

## Exersices
1.  Tom and Jerry are partners in their restaurant. In one hour,Tom can produce either 10 pizzas or 5 salads. In one hour, Jerry can produce 5 pizzas and 5 salads.
    * Who has the absolute advantage in producing pizzas?
        ```
        Tom since he produces the double of the amount than Jery in one hour
        ```
    * Who has the absolute advatage in producing salads?
        ```
        Noone
        ```
    * In which good should each partner specialize? 
        * Tom shoulw specialize in producing pizza since he has a lower oporutnity cost to producing pizza compared to Jerry. He can produce 10 pizzas for 5 salads when Jerry can produce 5 for the same 5 salads.
        ```
        Tom:
            1 Salad = 2 pizza
        Jerry:
            1 salad = 1 pizza
        ```
